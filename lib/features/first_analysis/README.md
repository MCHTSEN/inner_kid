# First Analysis Feature

## Overview

The First Analysis feature allows users to upload a child's drawing and answer a series of questions to provide context for psychological analysis. The feature follows a step-by-step flow with smooth animations and intuitive UI/UX.

**ðŸš€ Current Status**: Fully implemented with mock data and placeholder APIs
**ðŸ”„ API Integration**: Ready for real API connections (marked with `ðŸ”„ TODO API:` throughout)

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Approach

This feature is built with a **mock-first approach** to ensure perfect UI/UX before API integration:

âœ… **Completed (Ready for Production UI/UX):**
- Complete user flow with animations
- Progressive question revelation
- Auto-scroll functionality  
- Native platform dialogs
- Beautiful paywall with pricing plans
- Comprehensive results page with mock insights
- Progress tracking and state management

ðŸ”„ **TODO (API Integration Phase):**
- Real image analysis service connection
- Payment processing integration  
- Backend results fetching
- User authentication system
- Push notifications setup

This approach allows for rapid UI iteration and perfect user experience before connecting to real services.

## Architecture

The feature follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with clean separation of concerns:

```
lib/features/first_analysis/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis_question.dart      # Question data model
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ first_analysis_state.dart   # State management model
â”œâ”€â”€ viewmodel/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ first_analysis_viewmodel.dart # Business logic & state management
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image_upload_widget.dart     # Image upload UI component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ question_widget.dart         # Question display & interaction
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ progress_indicator_widget.dart # Progress tracking UI
â”œâ”€â”€ first_analysis_page.dart        # Main page view
â””â”€â”€ README.md                       # This documentation
```

## User Flow

1. **Initial State**: User sees only the image upload widget with progress indicator
2. **Image Upload**: User can upload from gallery or camera via native dialogs
3. **Auto-scroll**: Page automatically scrolls down as questions are answered
4. **Questions Appear**: After image upload, questions appear progressively
5. **Progressive Answering**: Each answered question collapses to a summary line with animations
6. **Completion**: All questions answered shows submit button
7. **Paywall**: Shows premium pricing options before analysis
8. **Payment**: ðŸ”„ TODO API: Real payment processing integration needed
9. **Results**: Navigate to detailed analysis results page
10. **Analysis**: ðŸ”„ TODO API: Real image analysis API integration needed

## Components

### Models

#### `AnalysisQuestion`
```dart
class AnalysisQuestion {
  final String id;           // Unique identifier
  final String question;     // Question text
  final List<String> options; // Answer options
  final String? selectedAnswer; // Selected answer
  
  bool get isAnswered; // Helper getter
}
```

#### `FirstAnalysisState`
```dart
class FirstAnalysisState {
  final File? uploadedImage;        // Uploaded image file
  final List<AnalysisQuestion> questions; // All questions
  final int currentQuestionIndex;   // Current active question
  final bool isImageUploaded;      // Image upload status
  final bool isCompleted;          // Analysis completion status
  final bool isLoading;            // Loading state
  
  // Helper getters
  AnalysisQuestion? get currentQuestion;
  List<AnalysisQuestion> get answeredQuestions;
  bool get allQuestionsAnswered;
  double get progress;
}
```

### ViewModel

#### `FirstAnalysisViewModel`
Manages the business logic and state using Riverpod StateNotifier:

**Key Methods:**
- `uploadImageFromGallery()` - Upload from device gallery
- `uploadImageFromCamera()` - Upload from device camera  
- `answerQuestion(String questionId, String answer)` - Answer a question
- `submitAnalysis()` - Submit completed analysis (ðŸ”„ TODO API: Connect to real analysis service)
- `reset()` - Reset the entire analysis

**Provider:**
```dart
final firstAnalysisViewModelProvider = 
    StateNotifierProvider<FirstAnalysisViewModel, FirstAnalysisState>(
  (ref) => FirstAnalysisViewModel(),
);
```

## State Management

Uses Flutter Riverpod for reactive state management:

1. **State Updates**: ViewModel updates state immutably
2. **UI Reactions**: Widgets rebuild automatically on state changes
3. **Side Effects**: Async operations handled in ViewModel
4. **Provider Scope**: Single source of truth for analysis state

## Error Handling

- Image picker errors are caught and handled gracefully
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous operations
- Validation ensures all questions are answered before submission
- Reset functionality allows starting over

## Accessibility

- Semantic labels for screen readers
- High contrast colors for text and backgrounds
- Large touch targets for buttons
- Clear visual hierarchy

    builder: (context) => const FirstAnalysisPage(),
  ),
);

// Or use in a ProviderScope
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ProviderScope(

        home: FirstAnalysisPage(),
      ),
    );
  }
